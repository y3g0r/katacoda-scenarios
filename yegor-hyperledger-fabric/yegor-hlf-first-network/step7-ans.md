All steps are listed here [documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/build_network.html#what-s-happening-behind-the-scenes). But in order to truly understand them you have to understand hyperledger fabric.

Here's a short summary:
- All components start, initialize and connect (through the [channel](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#channel) 'mychannel')
- [Smart contract](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#smart-contract) ('chaincode' in fabric parlance) gets installed on different [peers](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#peer). All reads and writes to a [ledger](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#ledger) ([blockchain](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#chain) + [world state DB](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#world-state)) happens based on chaincode response to a transaction [proposal](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#proposal). Response may be either an error or a [Read-Write set](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/readwrite.html#read-write-set-semantics). Read set contains current data from the ledger. Write set captures new data which should be written to the ledger when transaction will be [committed](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#commit).
- Chaincode is [invoked](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#invoke), and then [queried](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#query) to make sure that [transactions](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/glossary.html#transaction) were successfully committed to a legder.
